‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen utilizes industry-standard protocols: [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) are used for generating Bitcoin addresses.  For EVM-based chains, such as Ethereum, it employs [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing.

The software rapidly generates a large number of potential wallet addresses. It then compares these addresses against databases of known, potentially valuable addresses or checks their balances in real-time using public blockchain explorers. The goal: to efficiently identify wallets that may contain lost funds.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, promoting transparency and enabling users to modify the code.  Compared to alternative tools, Wallet Gen demonstrates significantly enhanced wallet generation speeds, leveraging your CPU & GPU for optimal performance.

##  Why WalletGen?

If you need expert assistance in recovering your lost cryptocurrency, **WalletGen** provides the edge you require. Engineered in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU utilization, it delivers performance that is up to **10x faster** than alternative brute-force tools. Whether you're exploring previously inaccessible wallets, validating potential key spaces, or seeking to reclaim your assets, WalletGen provides the speed and security you need.

## Features

-   **Comprehensive Wallet Generation:** Allows you to generate wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and other major cryptocurrencies.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** facilitates brute-force searches, letting you identify crypto wallets with existing balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Select option 3 in the menu or execute start_search_btc.bat to search for Bitcoin wallets via the internet. This may take longer as it depends on real-time checks via blockchain explorers.
*   Choose option 6 to search for Bitcoin wallets using the database. This method significantly increases speed by comparing generated wallets against a pre-compiled database of known addresses with balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Choose option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets over the internet. This verifies balances in real-time using blockchain explorers.
*   Choose option 6 to search for EVM wallets using the database. This optimizes the process by comparing generated wallets against a database of addresses known to have balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The search speed is heavily impacted by your hardware, particularly the GPU. To maximize speed and increase your chances of finding a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple program instances (1 to 4), based on your system's capacity.

Utilizing the database greatly increases search efficiency, eliminating the need for frequent blockchain queries.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

Once a wallet with a balance is found:
*   The program will **immediately halt** the search.
*   The wallet details will be **displayed** in the console.
*   This information will be **saved** in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### Accessing the Funds:
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the located wallet into any compatible crypto wallet application (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  After restoration, you can transfer the funds to your own secure wallet.

>  If you are successful in your search, kindly consider donating a small portion of the recovered balance as a thank you!

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen includes functionality designed to recover your Bitcoin wallet utilizing the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program supports both entering a complete seed phrase, and searching for missing words utilizing specific characters.

### Process Explanation

#### Searching for Missing Words:

If your seed phrase is incomplete, or you have words that are uncertain, substitute those words with an *. WalletGen will then explore all possible combinations in place of * to determine the correct seed phrase, and restore the linked wallet's balance.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you have the complete 12-word seed phrase, simply enter it into the program. WalletGen will generate various address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH) and check their balances.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases should be exactly 12 words long.
*   Use only the * symbol to designate missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can be time-consuming, particularly when multiple words are missing.
*   Successful wallet recovery, where a balance is identified, will trigger the program to automatically cease operation and save the findings.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/texts/track.webp)


I‚Äôve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).  
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
